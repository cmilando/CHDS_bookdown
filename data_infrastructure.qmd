| **BU Shared Computing Cluster (SCC)** | High-performance computing (HPC) system supporting large-scale data processing and modeling                         | Thousands of CPU cores, GPU nodes, parallel computing, genomics/claims analysis support        | Steep learning curve for non-technical users; some limitations on sensitive data storage         |
| **BMC CDW-R (BMC EHR)**          | De-identified and limited datasets from BMCâ€™s Epic EHR, optimized for research with underserved populations         | Clinical, demographic, encounter-level data; equity-focused use cases                          | Typical EHR issues (e.g., missing data, variable coding); may not generalize beyond BMC patients |
| **BEDAC Secure Research Cloud (SRC)** | HIPAA-compliant, access-controlled cloud for working with sensitive health data                                     | Secure environment for EHR/claims data; tools include R, SAS, Python, SQL                      | Requires IRB & DUA approvals; onboarding time; limited to approved users                         |
