| **American Community Survey (ACS)**              | Annual U.S. Census survey covering 3.5M households. Offers tract-level demographic, housing, and economic data. Key for policy and spatial analysis. Estimates have margins of error for small areas.                          |             
| **CMS Medicaid**                                 | Claims and enrollment data for 70M+ Medicaid beneficiaries. Strong for analyzing access, costs, and care use in low-income populations. Limitations include state variability and reporting lags.                             |             
| **CMS Medicare**                                 | Claims and enrollment data for ~65M older or disabled Americans. Ideal for longitudinal studies of healthcare use in older adults. Lacks younger/uninsured populations and clinical granularity.                              |             
| **CMS T-MSIS**                                   | Standardized Medicaid/CHIP data from all states. Includes claims, enrollment, and provider data. Designed for national comparability. Challenging to use; varies in quality across states.                                    |             
| **CHIA APCD**                                    | Massachusetts all-payer claims database covering ~80% of the population. Strong for health utilization and insurance analysis. Lacks uninsured individuals and comprehensive race/ethnicity data.                              |             
| [**MarketScan**](data_Marketscan.qmd)                                    | Proprietary claims database with 200M+ covered lives. Detailed data for commercially insured individuals. Excellent for utilization and cost studies, but not generalizable to public/uninsured populations.                 |             
| **EPIC/EHR**                                     | Clinical EHR data from EPIC systems. Rich in labs, diagnoses, medications, and procedures. Granular and timely, but limited to care within EPIC networks and varies by institution.                                            |             
| **OptumLabs Data Warehouse**                     | Longitudinal EHR and claims for 200M+ commercial and Medicare Advantage enrollees. Strong for real-world evidence studies. Proprietary; limited Medicaid and uninsured data.                                                   |             
| **ADVANCE Data Warehouse**                       | PCORnet-affiliated EHR and claims data from safety-net clinics (e.g., OCHIN). Strong equity lens; over 7M underserved patients. Less generalizable to broader populations.                                                    |             
| **CDC Platforms (WONDER, mRFEI, PLACES, etc.)**  | Public health datasets including mortality (WONDER), food environment (mRFEI), local disease burden (PLACES), and life expectancy (USALEEP). Easy access, but often ecological with time lags.                                |             
| **Census**                                       | Decennial population count (~330M U.S. residents). Provides full coverage demographic and housing data. Used for policy, planning, and allocation. Conducted every 10 years; limited variable detail.                         |             
| **HRSA**                                         | Health access and provider shortage data, including HPSAs and FQHCs. Covers underserved regions and providers. Ideal for access-to-care studies; lacks clinical or patient-level detail.                                       |             
| **IMLS**                                         | Library and museum usage and operations data from thousands of institutions. Useful for civic infrastructure research. No individual health data and few public health indicators.                                            |             
| **USDA (e.g., Food Access Atlas, SNAP data)**    | Food environment, SNAP participation, and rurality measures. Common in food insecurity and rural health work. Data are ecological and updates can lag behind.                                                                 |
