    "text": "The Boston Biorepository, Recruitment, and Integrative Network (BBRAIN) is a national research resource created to advance the study of Gulf War Illness (GWI), a chronic multisymptom condition affecting veterans of the 1990–91 Gulf War. GWI presents with persistent symptoms such as fatigue, pain, cognitive dysfunction, gastrointestinal issues, respiratory problems, and skin abnormalities. Because diagnosis has historically relied on self-reported symptoms and lacks validated biological markers, the field has been limited by fragmented datasets, small samples, inconsistent measurement, and difficulty validating findings across studies. BBRAIN was created to address these barriers by establishing a centralized biorepository and integrated data network designed to support large-scale, harmonized, and reproducible GWI research.\n\nKeating et al. describes BBRAIN in detail, summarized below:\nBBRAIN includes:\n\na formal data and biospecimen access system\nan online request form\na steering committee review process\nstandardized operating procedures for data sharing and sample handling\n\n\nData Dictionary, Metadata, Years Available\nBBRAIN places significant emphasis on data harmonization through the use of Common Data Elements (CDEs). These CDEs standardize how symptom questions, exposures, clinical assessments, and other variables are measured and recorded, enabling datasets from different studies and institutions to be combined more easily and reliably. By harmonizing these variables, BBRAIN reduces inconsistencies and enhances opportunities for replication, meta-analysis, biomarker discovery, and validation studies. This effort represents a major step forward for the GWI field, which has historically struggled with inconsistent measures and incompatible datasets.\nThe network also provides structured processes for data and biospecimen access. Researchers can apply to access BBRAIN materials through a centralized request system. Each request is reviewed by a steering committee to ensure scientific rigor and appropriate use of resources. The infrastructure includes governance structures, documentation standards, protocols for storing and transferring biospecimens, and processes for monitoring scientific output. The article notes that the biorepository and dataset merging infrastructure were already established at the time of publication, and retrospective datasets had been successfully combined.\n\n\nHow to access\nReach out to bedacprp@bu.edu"

    "text": "Copied from https://www.alzheimers.gov/taking-action/national-research-centers:\nOriginally established in 1984, the Alzheimer’s Disease Research Centers (ADRCs) are Congressionally designated Centers of Excellence. The ADRCs support the nation’s increased effort to address Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Alzheimer’s disease-related dementias (ADRD) by providing information, local resources, support, and opportunities to participate in research. These centers are dedicated to developing and testing new ways to detect, diagnose, treat, and prevent dementia and to improving care for people with these diseases and their families. NIA and NIH fund ADRCs at research institutions across the United States. Each Center has a specific theme based on local populations and scientific areas of interest.\nThe ADRC program prioritizes collaboration and communication, as well as sharing resources, approaches, and results among centers and to outside researchers. By working collaboratively, the ADRCs have made significant contributions to addressing AD and ADRD.\nFor families affected by Alzheimer’s and related dementias, ADRCs offer:\nHelp with obtaining diagnosis and managing care for persons living with dementia Information about the diseases, new research findings, services, and resources Opportunities to learn about active clinical trials and participate in research studies that contribute to improved understanding of dementia, which may lead to new treatments and better care Support groups and other special programs for volunteers and their families Opportunity to obtain an autopsy at end of life, with a report provided to the family The History of Alzheimer’s Disease Research Centers The main objectives of the ADRCs program are to:\nConduct cutting-edge basic, clinical, and translational research and provide resources and infrastructure to address AD and ADRD Research Implementation Milestones Train the next generation of researchers in an environment that supports interactions across scientific disciplines Provide information to the public about research findings, access to support services, and opportunities to participate in research How Alzheimer’s Disease Research Centers Advance Research ADRCs conduct research spanning from the causes of and risk factors for AD and ADRD to potential treatments to managing symptoms and helping families cope. Center activities include:\nClinical Research: ADRCs each have a “Clinical Core” of research volunteers who come to the ADRC annually as part of a long-term study of aging and the brain. Volunteers complete annual tests and assessments that help researchers gather invaluable data to explore innovative approaches to diagnosis, treatment, and disease prevention. Outreach, Recruitment and Engagement: Each of the centers supports robust efforts to help raise awareness of AD and ADRD, inform the public about the latest research, support families, and recruit people to participate in research. ADRCs have created community programs, support groups, and informational materials. Centers recruit volunteers from their local community with a focus on populations that are understudied and/or are at higher risk for AD/ADRD to participate in research. To facilitate knowledge sharing across centers and with the wider dementia research community, many resources are available through the NIA-supported Alzheimer’s and Dementia Outreach, Recruitment, and Engagement (ADORE) repository. Data Sharing: Data collection and sharing helps researchers better understand diseases and develop effective treatment and prevention strategies. ADRCs share data and samples with a number of connected AD and ADRD repositories. The National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center collects standardized data from all of the ADRCs and shares deidentified data with other qualified investigators. The ADRCs also send biological samples to the National Centralized Repository for Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias, genetic information to the Alzheimer’s Disease Genetics Consortium, and brain scans to the Standardized Centralized Alzheimer’s and Related Dementias Neuroimaging. These large-scale data sharing efforts enable researchers to make discoveries that would not be possible with smaller sample sizes. Much of the important progress in Alzheimer’s and other dementia research in the United States during the past 40 years stems from research conducted at — or with the help of resources provided by — the ADRCs. For example, ADRC researchers have:\nConducted a significant amount of the research on the processes behind amyloid plaque and tau tangle formation in the brain, which are hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease. Characterized abnormal proteins associated with several different neurodegenerative diseases. Evaluated cognitive changes associated with normal aging and the transitions from early difficulties thinking and remembering to dementia. Identified factors that contribute to changes in cognitive abilities, such as social and physical activity. Related changes in brain structure to the clinical stages of Alzheimer’s using information gathered from participants during cognitive tests and assessments, brain imaging scans, and autopsies of donated brains. Helped to define a newly described type of dementia, Limbic-Predominant Age-Related TDP-43 Encephalopathy (LATE)"

Research across these sites focuses primarily on alcohol and substance use and their effects on HIV disease progression, along with a range of other clinical and behavioral outcomes.\nAccess The repository is restricted-access. Investigators must request permission to obtain datasets.\nNotes and Considerations\nThe three cohorts differ substantially in demographic and behavioral characteristics, and many investigators focus on analyses within a single cohort.\nCross-cohort analyses are possible but often challenging to justify. For example, substance-use patterns differ dramatically across sites (e.g., minimal drug use in Uganda versus predominantly injection-drug use in the Russia cohort).\nSeveral available datasets originate from clinical trials.\n\nHow to access\nReach out to bedacprp@bu.edu"
