    "text": "This table summarizes commonly used data sources for population health, health services, and social science research at BU. It includes administrative claims, EHR, survey, and public health datasets.\n\n\n\nResource\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nData Axle\nBusiness and consumer dataset covering 15M+ U.S. businesses and 300M consumers. Useful for market research and outreach. Proprietary; may lack public health relevance or timeliness.\n\n\nAmerican Community Survey (ACS)\nAnnual U.S. Census survey covering 3.5M households. Offers tract-level demographic, housing, and economic data. Key for policy and spatial analysis. Estimates have margins of error for small areas.\n\n\nCMS Medicaid\nClaims and enrollment data for 70M+ Medicaid beneficiaries. Strong for analyzing access, costs, and care use in low-income populations. Limitations include state variability and reporting lags.\n\n\nCMS Medicare\nClaims and enrollment data for ~65M older or disabled Americans. Ideal for longitudinal studies of healthcare use in older adults. Lacks younger/uninsured populations and clinical granularity.\n\n\nCMS T-MSIS\nStandardized Medicaid/CHIP data from all states. Includes claims, enrollment, and provider data. Designed for national comparability. Challenging to use; varies in quality across states.\n\n\nCHIA APCD\nMassachusetts all-payer claims database covering ~80% of the population. Strong for health utilization and insurance analysis. Lacks uninsured individuals and comprehensive race/ethnicity data.\n\n\nMarketScan\nProprietary claims database with 200M+ covered lives. Detailed data for commercially insured individuals. Excellent for utilization and cost studies, but not generalizable to public/uninsured populations.\n\n\nEPIC/EHR\nClinical EHR data from EPIC systems. Rich in labs, diagnoses, medications, and procedures. Granular and timely, but limited to care within EPIC networks and varies by institution.\n\n\nOptumLabs Data Warehouse\nLongitudinal EHR and claims for 200M+ commercial and Medicare Advantage enrollees. Strong for real-world evidence studies. Proprietary; limited Medicaid and uninsured data.\n\n\nADVANCE Data Warehouse\nPCORnet-affiliated EHR and claims data from safety-net clinics (e.g., OCHIN). Strong equity lens; over 7M underserved patients. Less generalizable to broader populations.\n\n\nCDC Platforms (WONDER, mRFEI, PLACES, etc.)\nPublic health datasets including mortality (WONDER), food environment (mRFEI), local disease burden (PLACES), and life expectancy (USALEEP). Easy access, but often ecological with time lags.\n\n\nCensus\nDecennial population count (~330M U.S. residents). Provides full coverage demographic and housing data. Used for policy, planning, and allocation. Conducted every 10 years; limited variable detail.\n\n\nHRSA\nHealth access and provider shortage data, including HPSAs and FQHCs. Covers underserved regions and providers. Ideal for access-to-care studies; lacks clinical or patient-level detail.\n\n\nIMLS\nLibrary and museum usage and operations data from thousands of institutions. Useful for civic infrastructure research. No individual health data and few public health indicators.\n\n\nUSDA (e.g., Food Access Atlas, SNAP data)\nFood environment, SNAP participation, and rurality measures. Common in food insecurity and rural health work. Data are ecological and updates can lag behind."
