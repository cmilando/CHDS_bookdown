URBAN ARCH Data Overview

URBAN ARCH maintains a [data repository[(https://sites.bu.edu/urbanarch/resources/data-sample-repository/) that provides detailed information on all available datasets. The full catalog is accessible through the project’s website.

Years Available
2012–2022

Population
The URBAN ARCH consortium includes three cohorts of people living with HIV in Mbarara, Uganda; St. Petersburg, Russia; and Boston, Massachusetts. Research across these sites focuses primarily on alcohol and substance use and their effects on HIV disease progression, along with a range of other clinical and behavioral outcomes.

Access
The repository is restricted-access. Investigators must request permission to obtain datasets.

Notes and Considerations

The three cohorts differ substantially in demographic and behavioral characteristics, and many investigators focus on analyses within a single cohort.

Cross-cohort analyses are possible but often challenging to justify. For example, substance-use patterns differ dramatically across sites (e.g., minimal drug use in Uganda versus predominantly injection-drug use in the Russia cohort).

Several available datasets originate from clinical trials.
